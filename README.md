# Jigsaw Puzzle Solver using Edge Contour Profiles - project for the Image Processing and Computer Vision course

## Description

This project is designed to **solve jigsaw puzzles by analyzing the contours of individual pieces**. The algorithm identifies and extracts edges, classifies piece shapes, and matches them to reconstruct the puzzle, similar to how humans solve puzzles by focusing on piece contours rather than colors or patterns.

The project includes:
- A **Jupyter Notebook** that implements the main algorithm using computer vision techniques through OpenCV2.
- **Python scripts** for batch processing and modifying the image database.
- An **image database** containing over 400 puzzle pieces, representing about half of an actual full puzzle.
- **P5.js files** to visually represent the reconstructed puzzle using the data extracted from Python and the Jupyter Notebook.

The main of the code runs in the Notebook, and also includes a complete explanation of the entire project, including an analysis of the reconstruction made in P5JS.
